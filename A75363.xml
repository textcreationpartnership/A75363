            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIS Majeſty of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> having, as you have been already informed, ſurprized the States and people of the <hi>Hague</hi> with his ſuedain Arrival into that place, which prevented not only the Burghers from appearing in their Arms, but the Lords of that Countrey from performing the great Teſtimony of their Rejoycing, at his coming among them, by playing their Fire-works, and making other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Demonſtrations of his ſafe and happy Arrival; they beſought the King, though much againſt his Inclination, as coming to do Buſineſs in their Countrey, To permit that a Day might be prefixed, and his Majeſty be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to do them the honour, to make his publick Entrance into the <hi>Hague;</hi> which he yielded to, and ordered to be performed on the 5th of <hi>February,</hi> S. N. Which began at three of the Clock that Afternoon: Which was carried on, and contained that Variety and Greatneſs of Splendour, as to exceed any thing of that Nature theſe many Ages.</p>
            <p>There were erected three very Coſtly Triumphal Arches, imbelliſhed with Gold, Rich Carvings and Curioſity of Phantaſies in Painting: That before the Palace very Regular and Noble, larger than any of the Gates of <hi>London,</hi> and not unlike, in Form, to that of <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and had the King's Effigies on Horſe back, Gilded, and ſet upon the Top, the whole painted in Friſco; and had a great Portar and two ſmaller ones on each ſide: The others were in different Forms, with diverſe Latine Devices or Motto's under them, relating to the King and this preſent Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The King went out of the Back-Gate of the Pallace, and fetching a Round in his Coach, with his Attendants, came into the further end of the <hi>Hague,</hi> riding quite through the Town, paſſed through all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Arches, the Streets being lined with the States soldiers, and crowded with innumerable Throngs of People; And made their Cavalcade in this like Order.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151501:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>There preceeded a Party of the King's Horſe-Guards, with Trumpets and Kettle-Drums: After them a Body of Switzers, not much unlike our Yeomen of the Guard: And were followed by his Majeſties Footmen in excellent Order; Then came one of the King's Coaches, with ſix Horſes, carrying his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> with ſome other Engliſh Noblemen therein: Which was ſucceeded by another of His Majeſties Coaches, filled with the Nobility: in the third, which was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Rich, rode his Majeſty, and the <hi>Heer Overkirk,</hi> with many Pages on both Sides: After which came the Coach of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> with Pages and Footmen, in very rich Liveries: And was followed by that of the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> twelve Footmen running by the Side of their Horſes, with four Pages: And the Lord <hi>Durſley,</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Envoy Extraordinary to the States General, in his Coach; With that of Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> the King's Envoy Extraordinay at the Court of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> cloſed the Rear; which making ſome Interval. There were a great many Coaches of the Nobles, Lords and States of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, with a great Appearance of the Miniſters of Foreign Princes, Allies there, made a Noble Cavalcade. The Burghers, being in the Nature of our Trained Bands, marched in all their Gaiety, and made a Handſome Appearance; And when the King entred the Palace, were drawn up, and made ſeveral good Vollies; and many great Guns, brought thither on this Occaſion, proclaimed aloud the Rejoycing for this Ineſteemable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of the King's Preſence. When it came to be dark, the Fire-Works, which were very Curious and Divertiſing, began to Play. In ſhort, the Night concluded with Ringing of Bells, Boon-fires and Illuminations, with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles ſet behind Tranſparent Painted Devices and Pictures, in divers of the Windows in the Streets of the Town. The Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> was juſt then arrived, and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> expected in two days: And all concluded with the greateſt Order and Regularity imaginable.</p>
            <p>Before the Court there is the Effigies of our King on Horſe-back, richly Embelliſhed all over with Gold, and on each ſide the Arch are Eight Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Copper above the Pedeſtal of the King's Horſe, and there is wrote, <q>
